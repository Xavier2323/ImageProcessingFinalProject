# ImageProcessingFinalProject
Developed a colorization algorithm and applied it to the Oregon Wildlife dataset for experimental evaluation

# How to run
Since the dataset is too large, you will have to download [it](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/virtualdvid/oregon-wildlife) yourself and fix the path(put it under the same directory as main.py)
